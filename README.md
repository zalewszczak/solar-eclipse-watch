# Eclipz

A Pebble Time 2 (emery platform) solar eclipse watchface, written in C
(watch app) and JavaScript (PebbleKit JS + a self-contained settings
page).

## Project layout

```
src/c/          Watch app (C)
src/pkjs/        Phone-side JS: astronomy/weather fetching, and the
                 settings page itself
resources/       Fonts and images declared in package.json
scripts/         Build-time helper scripts (see below)
```

## Building

```
pebble build
pebble install --emulator emery
```

## Marker style preview images

The big-analog watchface mode has several "bitmap" marker styles
(Modern, Swiss, Tally, Bell, Brown), each using its own PNG resource
under `resources/images/<name>_background.png`. The settings page can
show a live preview of each style's artwork so you see it before
applying -- but since that settings page is a single self-contained
`data:` URI with no server behind it, it has no way to load an
external image file when it's actually open on the phone. The preview
images have to already be embedded in the page's HTML by the time the
app is built.

That embedding is handled by:

```
node scripts/generate-marker-previews.js
```

Run this **before** `pebble build`, any time you add or change one of
the `*_background.png` files in `resources/images/`. It reads
whatever's there, base64-encodes it, and writes
`src/pkjs/marker-preview-images.js` -- a generated file the settings
page requires and embeds directly. No separate preview-only files are
needed: whatever art a marker style already uses on the watch is
exactly what shows as its preview in settings.

You don't need every style's PNG to exist for this to work -- any
style missing a `*_background.png` simply shows no preview image in
settings (not an error, and it doesn't affect that style working on
the watch itself). The committed placeholder
(`src/pkjs/marker-preview-images.js` with no entries) means the app
also builds fine before you've added any of these images at all.

### Running it automatically

`pebble build` has no plugin/hook system of its own, so to avoid
remembering this step by hand, either:

- Add an npm script and use `npm run build` instead of `pebble build`
  directly:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "node scripts/generate-marker-previews.js && pebble build"
  }
  ```

- Or add `node scripts/generate-marker-previews.js` to whatever shell
  alias/CI step you already use to invoke `pebble build`.

### Keep the source PNGs reasonably small

Everything the script embeds ends up base64-encoded (about 33% larger
than the raw file) inside the settings page's own HTML, which is
itself one big `data:` URI passed to the phone's webview. The simple
white-on-transparent mask art these marker styles already use is
fine. Full-resolution photos or anything visually complex will bloat
the page and risk hitting inconsistent limits across different
phones/OS versions.
